# epidemiology-analysis

This repository contains projects focused on exploring epidemiological data, particularly analyzing relationships between various risk 
factors and health outcomes. Each project uses real-world datasets and applies statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover 
patterns and associations that impact public health.

## Project Folders

### 1. NHANES: Cancer Risk and Epidemiological Factors
In this project, I explored the relationship between **age**, **smoking history**, **sex**, and the likelihood of developing **cancer**. 
Using data from the **NHANES dataset**, I applied several statistical methods to investigate these associations:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing the distribution of age, smoking status, and sex across the dataset.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Building a machine learning model to assess the combined importance of all factors in predicting cancer
- status.
  
## Methods Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial exploration of the dataset using visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A machine learning algorithm used to evaluate the combined importance of features and their relationship
to cancer risk.
- **Permutation Importance**: Assessing the impact of each feature on model performance by shuffling feature values and measuring the
resulting reduction in performance.

## Future Work

Future projects will explore other epidemiological datasets and health outcomes
